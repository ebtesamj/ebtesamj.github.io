        <p>afghan necklaces are famous for the way they are carefully crafted and vary in styles. the necklaces aren’t just pieces of jewellery, but rather, they symbolize afghan culture. afghan necklaces come in four main styles, the first being a layered stack necklace, these necklaces are quite common in more nomadic tribes as they often opt for flashy designs. the second is the extended choker. this style is somewhere in between the heavy layered stack and the regular choker. the original choker is the most popular. these necklaces are often made up of mixed metals but they’re also commonly crafted with silver. this style is very popular amongst young girls when in attendance at traditional henna nights. the beaded necklace is a very historic style. this style of necklace is composed up of glass beads and are usually bunched together using many lines of bead to make up the necklace.

        <p>afghan jewellery is incomplete without the infamous headpieces. the headpieces usually vary in style, size and design based on the ethnic group. the pashtun style headpiece is a full headpiece that has to be placed on over the head. it fully goes over the head allowing for chains to lay over the head. the tajik balochi style headpiece is a simple traditional tikka-style headpiece. balochi culture is very similar to south asian, hence the jhumka style jewellery. the tajik headpiece is very unique from the other three since its a hat like headpiece. the hat is covered in metal work, chains, and detailed works that hang off. this style holds alot of influence from ottoman fashion. the final headpiece, the uzbek one, is a hazara style wrap around headpiece that has point flat metal tassel-like design circling it.

        <p>afghan earrings are one of the more uniform accessories in terms of its variation. the designs are almost always consistent as they are all made up of some type of a disc or triangular metal with stained glass designs glued on top. the earrings do vary in size and trim though. some earrings have chains hanging off the edge and some have painted beads.the intricate look of afghan earrings is one of its most distinguishing characteristics. they are frequently created by combining metals, such brass or silver, that have been finely carved or embossed with conventional patterns and motifs. these motifs might be geometric forms, floral patterns, or very culturally significant components from the culture. some earrings may have glasswork, jewels, or vibrant beads to enhance luxury and improve their aesthetic appeal.</p>

        <p>bracelet cuffs are a vintage accessory in afghan culture, although its rare to see anyone wearing them casually, they were quite prominent in previous fashion trends for a long time. these accessories were made in many ways, some included carvings of dari literature and some even had precious gemstones embedded on the outer flat sides. most of these cuffs are made of a soft malleable metal of some sort but some are even made from woven fabrics. 
      these cuffs stand out because of their striking embellishments and colourful design. they are a statement piece accessory for sure. aside from visual value, bracelet cuffs have symbolic meaning in afghan culture. they are both decorative and practical since it is said that they provide protection and drive away evil spirits.  </p>
